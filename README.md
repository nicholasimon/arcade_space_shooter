An almost complete space shooting game in a retro arcade style. Arrow keys control movement, space bar shoots, F keys do various things (ie. F4 opens shop/F5 ends level) and keypad keys also do various things (ie. keypad 9 starts boss level). If you have issues getting it to run make sure the resolution is 1920X1080
